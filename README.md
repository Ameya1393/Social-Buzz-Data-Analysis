# Social-Buzz-Data-Analysis
## Client background:
Social Buzz was founded by two former engineers from a large social media conglomerate, one
from London and the other from San Francisco. They left in 2008 and both met in San
Francisco to start their business. They started Social Buzz because they saw an opportunity to
build on the foundation that their previous company started by creating a new platform where
content took center stage. Social Buzz emphasizes content by keeping all users anonymous,
only tracking user reactions on every piece of content. There are over 100 ways that users can
react to content, spanning beyond the traditional reactions of likes, dislikes, and comments.
This ensures that trending content, as opposed to individual users, is at the forefront of user
feeds. 

## Scenario : Our team of dedicated professionals at Accenture has been tasked with analyzing and visualizing data for Social Buzz. This documentation serves as a comprehensive resource to understand the project's objectives, methodologies, and outcomes.
